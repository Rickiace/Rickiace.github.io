# Overview

The FoodieFinders web application allows users from University Of Manoa  to find restaurants that are available on the campus. Users are able to create an account and utilize the tools available for them on the website. If the user is a student the student is able to search for restaurants using a filter and they are able to leave reviews of restaurants they have eaten from. If the user is a vendor the vendor is allowed to create or add a restaurant to an already collection of restaurants for students to see and review.

# Role

My role in this final project was to handle how users data is collected and shown on the website. I created a collection to store users information such as their email, first name, last name, and their profile picture. After the user signs up for the website where she/he enters the information previously mentioned the user is able to view their profile on their "My Profile Page". On this page the user is able to see the information they have entered and the reviews they have made on restaurants they have visited they are also allowed to edit their account information and their review from this page. This page also have other small functionalities such as redirecting users to "Our Vendors Page" or if the user is a vendor there is a functionality where they are able to be redirected to add their restaurant. I also have a small role on the reviews where I had to use my collection to show the users first name and their profile picture on every review.
