# My Interests in Software Engineering

Since a very young age, I have always loved playing video games. Everyday when I come home from school, you can always find me playing video games on my computer and chatting with my friends. It’s always so exciting to start a new game and immerse myself in an entirely different world. The funny moments that I made with my friends were unforgettable times. However, when it came time for high school graduation, I didn’t know what to major in during college. Unlike many of my friends and classmates I haven't discover a strong passion to any particular field. As time passed I decided that software engineering might be a great fit for me, especially with have aspirations to delve into video game development. I made this choice from the desire to turn my love for gaming into a meaningful career. Additionally, my interest in coding grew alongside my hobby of building computers, I realized that I enjoy learning about the intricacies of software the same as hardware. Noticing that technology and electronics are slowly being more prominent in our everyday lives and that pretty much all industries use computers in some type of way. I figured that the job market would be extremely high for software engineers in the future and that’s why I chose software engineering as my career choice.

 In addition, the recent emergence of AI further strengthened my interest in software engineering. After the birth of ChatGPT, I realized the potential that software engineering had. AI could be easily accessible to everyone in our community and I personally think that it has the ability to alter our lives for the better. 

# Skills and Experiences I Hope to Develop

In the future, I hope to become more familiar with all the different coding languages. Unfortunately, I transferred over from Leeward Community College and had to take a large gap between my 200 level ICS classes and my 300 level ICS classes. As a result, I have to relearn a lot of the things that I have forgotten. This semester will definitely be a struggle for me, but I will try my best. 

Although coding skills are essential to be successful in the software engineering field, I also want to work on my soft skills this semester, such as my communication, problem solving, and critical thinking skills. I feel that I am a somewhat awkward person and I know that in the future, I will have to effectively meet and communicate with clients. I want to avoid and minimize miscommunication I may cause in the future in order to ensure that projects go as smoothly as possible.  In regards to my problem solving and critical thinking skills, I believe that those skills will slowly develop along with my coding skills. Having to code forces my brain to think of alternative ways to solve the same problem.
