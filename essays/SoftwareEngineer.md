# My Interests in Software Engineering

Since a very young age, I have always loved playing video games. Everyday when I come home from school, you can always find me playing video games on my computer and chatting with my friends. It’s always so exciting to start a new game and immerse myself in an entirely different world. The funny moments that I made with my friends were unforgettable times. However, when it came time for high school graduation, I didn’t know what to major in during college. The issue was that I didn’t have a strong passion for much…except for video games. I figured that software engineering would be a good fit for me because I wanted to get into video game development. 

I also noticed that technology and electronics are slowly being more prominent in our everyday lives. Also, pretty much all industries use computers in some type of way. I figured that the job market would be extremely high for software engineers in the future and that’s why I chose software engineering.

 In addition, the recent emergence of AI further strengthened my interest in software engineering. After the birth of ChatGPT, I realized the potential that software engineering had. AI could be easily accessible to everyone in our community and I personally think that it has altered our lives for the better. 

# Skills and Experiences I Hope to Develop

In the future, I hope to become more familiar with all the different coding languages. Unfortunately, I transferred over from Leeward Community College and had to take a large gap between my 200 level ICS classes and my 300 level ICS classes. As a result, I have to relearn a lot of the things that I have forgotten. This semester will definitely be a struggle for me, but I will try my best. 

Although coding skills are essential to be successful in the software engineering field, I also want to work on my soft skills this semester, such as my communication, problem solving, and critical thinking skills. I feel that I am a somewhat awkward person and I know that in the future, I will have to effectively meet and communicate with clients. I want to avoid and minimize miscommunication I may cause in the future in order to ensure that projects go as smoothly as possible.  In regards to my problem solving and critical thinking skills, I believe that those skills will slowly develop along with my coding skills. Having to code forces my brain to think of alternative ways to solve the same problem.
