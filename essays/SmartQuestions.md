Whenever I encounter an issue with my code, my first instinct is to Google it. While this often works and I am able to solve my question within the first ten minutes of searching, there are times where I end up spending hours trying to find an answer.  As I continue to struggle, I have slowly realized that in order to advance as a programmer, I will ask more and more questions that may not be easily answered. In order to do so, I must ask smart questions. I personally have not used forums such as StackOverFlow even though there are numerous experts that can help me due to my fear of being ridiculed online. I don’t want to get called out on a bad question but I genuinely need help sometimes. How can I effectively convey my issue to experts online? How can I write a post that stands out on online forums? How do I even begin to write these posts? These questions constantly plagued my brain. However, after reading Eric Raymond’s guide on <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"><i class="large github icon "></i>How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>, I finally understand the proper etiquette to asking smart questions. 


## Why are smart questions important for smart software engineers?
Understanding how to ask smart questions is extremely important for software engineers because communication is such an important part of the field. Effective communication can save everyone’s time and save a lot of stress in the long run. By crafting a well-formulated question and by providing as much information as you possibly can in a concise manner, your post will be more likely to be responded to. You must also keep in mind that the experts in the forums are, more often than not, answering questions out of their own time. In other words, they are volunteers and are therefore not required to answer your questions. Looking at the bigger picture, posting on an online forum is also an opportunity for the community to share knowledge and learn from each other. It’s not just a method to get answers to your problems. Your contribution to the forum allows others who have experienced the same issue to also learn from you. Therefore, it makes it even more crucial to learn how to ask smart questions. So what exactly are smart questions and what differentiates them from dumb ones? In short, smart questions are those that are detailed, straightforward, and show that you have already put in the time and effort to try to solve the issue. On the other hand, dumb questions are usually those that don’t contain enough information, waste people’s time, or can be simply searched for online. The following are examples of both smart and dumb questions: 


# Example of a good post

This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960473/get-all-unique-values-in-a-javascript-array-remove-duplicates"><i class="large github icon "></i>StackOverflow</a> post is an example of a smart question. The user starts with a header, “Get all unique values in a JavaScript array (remove duplicates),” that clearly states the problem that they are struggling with. Next, the person demonstrates that they have tried to research the problem beforehand, which expresses their willingness to learn. They even provided a link to a similar script that works in addition to a snippet of their own code. Furthermore, at the end of their post the user states, “So for the sake of helping me learn, can someone help me determine where the prototype script is going wrong?” This makes it more accessible for those who want to help, and also makes the question more understandable for those who are experiencing the same issue. The post is well thought-out with no grammatical or spelling errors. The post is now 14 years old and has become a resource for the online community. The fact that it has nearly 3,000 respondents and over 3 million views shows just how important it is to ask smart questions. 


# Example of a bad post

This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36028062/want-someone-to-do-my-homework-for-me"><i class="large github icon "></i>StackOverflow</a> post is an example of a bad question. The user titled this post “want someone to do my homework for me” which already gives a clear intention that the user just wants to waste someone's time and is not willing to learn anything from the question he posted. This user also did not give us any information on what he has tried doing to solve the problem and to make it worse, there are grammatical errors in the post and their tone makes them sound extremely rude and lazy. His attitude shows that he is just waiting for the answer to be given to him, rather than trying to understand his mistake and learn from it. This post was written over 7 years ago but it has been closed and is currently not accepting any more answers. 


# Conclusion
The analysis of the two examples above just proves how important it is to ask smark questions. Effective communication, in the form of asking smart questions, is essential in the software engineering industry. This is especially true on online forums where asking smart questions will lead to a valuable exchange of knowledge. As I continue to grow as a developer, I’ll do my best to remember how to ask smart questions, such as doing my own research before-hand, writing my question in an informative and concise manner, and to just use basic etiquette when asking. Asking smart questions will facilitate a better learning environment not only for me, but for the rest of the community as well.
