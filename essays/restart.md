# Fun With Javascript
So far I am having a lot of fun playing around and coding in Javascript. Despite being a complete newbie, I can see that there are some similarities between javascript and other coding languages. In my case, I haven’t coded in about two years so I found myself constantly saying, “Oh, I’ve seen this before” or, “This looks familiar”. Although I have not coded in a while, I found myself being able to complete around 80% of the practice problems until I got to recursions. I just could not wrap my head around them until I started writing them down on a piece of paper and inputting data manually. The biggest thing that caught me off guard, which I believe that's different from other coding languages, is that in JavaScript you do not have to declare whether or not your variables are going to be an integer or a string. In my opinion, this can be a great time saver since you can declare as many variables as you need and assign them to anything you want at a later time. I believe JavaScript is a great language and has a lot of potential because when I was doing the practice code and moving to the ES6 practices, I did not realize they were still updating and making JavaScript even easier to use by shortening code that you have to write.

# Restarting Is Tough
Since I had lost my prior knowledge of my fundamentals on basic coding, I had a hard time understanding and even starting on some of the practice WOD’s which are coding excercise that challenges our coding skills. This made me realize that I might have to put more time in just practicing coding and remembering simple concepts. When I started the timer for the second WOD, I was met with a difficult problem and my mind became blank. I was pretty stressed out and I did not want to watch the video tutorial without trying it first since I would not learn anything. At some point, I started to write what should happen on a piece of paper and I got the general idea on what I should do but I struggled to translate that over to JavaScript. I am concerned with my ability to complete these WOD’s since I know this is just the start of the semester and I know that there will be harder ones down the road.

# Great Way To Learn
I honestly like this type of learning since it forces me to think of all the possible methods to solve the same problem. Even after the WOD’s, I would sometimes just stare at it and try to think of other ways to solve the problem. I found the WODs to be very useful since it gave me a measurement on how much I should know and how much I am capable of doing. Although that is the case, they were very stressful especially knowing that there is a timer ticking and that you should complete it within a time limit. It will be very difficult without prior knowledge or basic understanding, but I think doing the WODs will benefit my future classes and future interviews.
