# BOOTSTRAP 5 VS HTML & CSS
There are many reasons why a software developer should learn how to use Bootstrap 5. For software developers who already have knowledge and experience in creating websites using HTML and CSS, learning Bootstrap 5 will be an easy task. Bootstrap 5 offers several advantages for developing responsive websites. One of the major benefits is the extensive library with pre-designed components, such as the navigation header. They also provide shortcuts and visually appealing icons that can be implemented on your website. Bootstrap 5 not only provides useful tools but also a large online library of resources to help software developers who are stuck or in the process of learning Bootstrap 5. This makes Bootstrap 5 more user-friendly and facilitates finding necessary information.

Although there are numerous advantages to using Bootstrap 5, it may not always be the most efficient framework when creating your own website. Firstly, as mentioned before, only software developers with knowledge and experience in creating websites using HTML and CSS will find Bootstrap 5 easier to use. Otherwise, Bootstrap 5 has a steep learning curve. Another scenario where it is better to use HTML or CSS instead of Bootstrap 5 is when the developer is working on small projects. If not organized properly, Bootstrap 5 can be hard to read when the project scope becomes larger. Therefore, using just HTML and CSS may result in simpler and more readable code.


# BOOTSTRAP 5 VS ME
I had never experienced creating a website page before, and learning how to do so with Bootstrap 5 made the experience even more complex. In my 314 class, we were assigned a practice WOD to practice HTML and CSS. I attempted the WOD but couldn't get anywhere near the expected result, so I ended up watching the videos that were given to see where I made mistakes and how it was supposed to be done. After a couple more WODs focusing on HTML and CSS, I finally started to get the hang of it, but as soon as I was getting comfortable, they assigned us to use Bootstrap 5. Suddenly, I was lost again; it got to the point where I didn't even know which was Bootstrap and which was pure HTML and CSS. I also had a hard time keeping up with my code. The amount of content we put in classes just to make a single section look the way it's supposed to be presented is crazy. Even now, I still don't understand when things should be in the CSS file or in the HTML file. There is only one thing I can say about Bootstrap 5: it definitely makes it easier to make the website look more appealing, but at the cost of my sanity.
